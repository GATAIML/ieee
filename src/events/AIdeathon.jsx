                    <p>
                        AIdeathons are brainstorming forums where individuals from different perspectives, talents, and interests get together to discuss challenging problems and propose practical solutions. Ideas, a solution, a road map, or an actionable strategy are all needed for an imagination. To develop futuristic ideas, solutions, roadmaps, or even an actionable strategy, teams will have to make use of cutting-edge technologies. Implementation is not necessary. However, a full analysis of the problem is expected. Participants can choose from a broad range of complex pressing situations.
